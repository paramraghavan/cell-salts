I was eighteen years old when I purchased a full set of Schüssler’s Twelve Tissue Salts. My parents had used these remedies from time to time when I was sick as a child, and, as a young woman I became intrigued by the delicious, little healing tablets. I also purchased a 36-remedy homeopathic kit along with handbooks for both kits.

I poured over these books and tried to understand how the 12 tissue salts differed from the 36 remedies in the homeopathic kit. Some remedies were common to both kits, and that puzzled me somewhat, especially since the descriptions of these remedies were not quite the same.

In spite of this confusion I used both kits, becoming especially fond of the tissue salts (also known as cell salts) as I got to know and use them, and like any group of friends, I had my favorites! These favorites have stayed with me and I use them still: a couple of doses of Kali mur for my ears if they snap, crackle, and pop after a cold, Kali phos for an energy boost after an acute illness or a stressful work period, Silica for a dry cough after getting chilled when run down.

### a little history 

W.H. Schüssler was a German physician in the late 1800s who became intrigued by the idea of how the cells of the human body were constructed. This subject of “cellular construction” was the cutting edge of physical pathology in Europe at that time, and was also being studied by scientist Rudolf Virchow, known as the “Father of Pathology.”

Schüssler investigated the chemical make-up of human cells and found that certain mineral salts were common to all cells and tissues. His basic theory revolves around the belief that the tissues or cells of the body can be broken down chemically into twelve inorganic mineral salts: calcium fluoride, calcium phosphate, calcium sulphate, phosphate of iron, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, potassium sulphate, magnesium phosphate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, sodium sulphate, and silica. He believed that disturbances in the levels of these salts cause disease, and the restoration of health is dependent on the administration of very small doses of the salt that is lacking. He used minimal doses, prepared according to homeopathic pharmaceutical principles (6X and 12X potencies), “corresponding in minuteness to the cellular salts in the tissues.” (1.)

Although Schüssler was familiar with homeopathy, he proclaimed his “biochemical system” of using tissue/cell salts as complete and separate from homeopathy. His indications for choosing a remedy were not based on homeopathic proving or the homeopathic principle of similars, but rather on his theories surrounding which mineral salts were deficient and needed to be supplemented. For example, since bone tissue is composed of calcium phosphate, calcium fluoride, and magnesium phosphate, Schüssler’s theory suggests that a bone problem could be helped by taking minute doses of these salts. For this reason, people think of his system as the homeopathic equivalent of mineral and vitamin supplementation.

Since most homeopathic remedies that are made from organic substances (i.e., plant or animal sources) can also be broken down chemically into these 12 mineral salts, Schüssler viewed his system as more fundamental than homeopathy and even superior to it.[

### simple and popular 

Schüssler’s tissue salts are popular around the world. They’re a hit with home prescribers who want a quick fix for simple ailments—or who become overwhelmed with the wider range of homeopathic remedies. In India, some homeopathic practitioners specialize in the tissue salts and use only these 12 remedies with all patients. Most British homeopaths use them to some extent—especially as a supportive measure in between constitutional remedies, targeting specific physical conditions or systems. Other homeopaths give their patients one dose of a high potency constitutional remedy to address the whole person (including the mental and emotional state or symptoms), and then send the patient home with a low potency tissue salt to address physical symptoms more directly.

### cell salt conundrum

The tissue salts are alleged to work at a cellular level, to redress physical imbalances, acting in effect more like “supplements” than homeopathic remedies—that was Schüssler’s theory, yet they are prepared in accordance with homeopathic pharmaceutical protocols, and are therefore considered homeopathic remedies. The Big Cell Salt Conundrum is this: Do they address only physical symptoms, in accordance with Schüssler’s indications? That is, do they work according to Schüssler’s supplemental or nutritional theories or do they work according to homeopathic principles, capable of healing the whole person (i.e., more than simply the physical symptoms)?

Here is what I think: There is no doubt that many of Schüssler’s descriptions of indications for these 12 remedies, based on his theories of cellular composition, have been validated in homeopathic clinical practice as well as through proving data. But the value of these remedies does not stop there; many of them have much broader homeopathic indications than those postulated by Schüssler. And it’s a myth that cell salts address only physical symptoms. The cell salt Natrum mur, (sodium chloride) for example, is also known as a deep-acting homeopathic remedy that can address mental and emotional, as well as physical symptoms. So, if a cell salt has a deeper affinity for a person, for the whole person rather than just a few symptoms, then it can effect a deeper healing—causing that person to feel much better in themselves. I remember one remarkable time when that person was a cat.

When my son was going through his growing years, he would turn into a “dishrag” from time to time—flopping on the sofa when he should have been up and at it, becoming almost impossible to wake in the morning, and not eating me out of house and home as he was known to do! At these times he would be generally uncommunicative except to complain—about anything he had to do, like his chores! At some point I would get smart and check his height against the kitchen door jamb I had assigned for the task and would find he had grown half an inch or more since I had last checked! I gave him Calc phos at these times, until his vitality and appetite were back up to speed and the complaining had ceased!  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### growing pains: dishrag, string bean kids 

Some kids suffer from horrid growing pains—especially the skinny, “string bean” children. The pains are more often in the muscles or long bones of the legs. They can also have pains in the knees or elbows as their joints catch up with their bones during the growth process. Some kids go through phases of complaining of stomach and/or headaches on coming home from school. Parents who track these often find that they occur before, during, or after a growth spurt, especially if the schoolwork has also been heavy. Calc phos will always help.

Those who are worn out or dull and sluggish become anemic (alternate Calc phos with Ferrum phos) and find it hard to concentrate. They look pale and thin. Their arms and legs can feel heavy and weak, and they can get cramps in the legs especially when walking (alternate Calc phos with Mag phos).

Keep track of your children’s height: a kitchen or garage doorjamb is perfect—or a piece of card tacked to a wall (with the bottom on the floor). Check it every few weeks…and give a course of Calc phos during and/or after a growth spurt to keep these kids from falling into a slump!

### deep healing in a skulking cat 

I taught an evening homeopathy class in a friend’s home many years ago. As we traipsed in one night, it was hard to miss the house cat skulking in a corner of the porch—her head turned to the wall, paying no attention to us. My friend Ann told us that 10-year old Minnie had exiled herself to the porch two whole days earlier, refusing to come in and refusing all food, in spite of the door being open most of the time, just in case. This behavior had started after Ann rescued a new kitten, Sophie, the week before. The kitten was entrancing the whole household with her sweetness and crazy antics while also getting all the attention. Much as I hate projecting human feelings onto animals, Minnie did indeed look somewhat resentful and even a bit sad. It so happened that I was teaching all about Schüssler’s tissue salts that night, and we decided that giving Minnie a dose of Natrum muriaticum couldn’t hurt. My friend dissolved a tablet of Natrum mur 6X in some water and rubbed a little onto Minnie’s outraged nose. We all went back to our books and let the cat be. About half an hour later, Minnie quietly came into the house, ate a little cat food, then climbed into the basket with Sophie, curled up with her, and fell fast asleep.

### it could be constitutional

Sometimes the cell salt remedy selected is constitutional, as in Minnie’s case—it doesn’t just fit the physical symptoms, it fits the whole person. In those cases, just a few doses can be enough to get that healing ball rolling. Or just one dose!

While Schüssler’s indications for Natrum mur were primarily physical symptoms related to the body’s water balance (since Natrum mur/sodium chloride is key in this regard), classical homeopaths know that there are many additional uses for this remedy, including its effectiveness in treating the ill effects of grief or disappointment when quiet resignation and the desire to be alone is a prominent symptom, as it was for Minnie.

Then again, sometimes a cell salt remedy, chosen based largely on Schüssler’s physical indications, can have a deep effect as well, as it did for me with a urinary tract infection.

### high in the pyrenees

As a young woman I lived for two years in a remote hamlet in the French Pyrenees. In cold weather, I was prone to getting a horrid urinary tract infection with the urge to go to the bathroom all the time and burning pains after I urinated. I noticed that this usually happened before my menstrual period and that I was much more emotional—weepy and irritable—than usual at that time. Studying my tissue salt handbook for a remedy, I vacillated between Natrum muriaticum and Natrum sulphuricum because both were said to regulate the balance of water and fluids in the body and both could be indicated for problems affected by cold weather. But Natrum mur seemed to be indicated more often for premenstrual complaints, and the clincher was the indication of cracked lips. I would often get either cracks at the corners of my mouth or a clean crack in the middle of my lower lip at this time and sometimes a cold sore. It was (and still is) amazing to me that this seemingly disparate collection of symptoms make a whole picture that can be used in a healing context.

From studying my homeopathic book, I could see that Natrum mur wasn’t such a good remedy for me overall with regard to my mental and emotional state (except the pre-menstrual state!), but when I compared my physical complaints with Natrum mur’s indications in the cell salt book, Natrum mur fit my symptoms well. So whenever I got a urinary infection, I would take Natrum mur 6X fairly frequently the first day and would immediately feel just plain better in myself. That feeling alone was lovely. Like a cozy, old armchair. By the end of that day, my urinary tract symptoms would be significantly improved and I could take the remedy less frequently until the symptoms had abated altogether a few days later.

### less is more

Schüssler used his 12 cell salt remedies primarily in the 6X potency—and that’s how remedies designated as “cell salts” or “tissue salts” on the label are still typically sold today (occasionally also 3X and 12X). Traditionally, they are made entirely in a pestle and mortar (or the modern factory equivalent) and are triturated (“diluted” but not with liquid) six times for a 6X potency: one part of the original mineral salt substance to nine parts of milk sugar and ground for a nice long time with each step. (2.)

The resulting soft powder is then pressed into forms, coming out as small, soft tablets that are flat on the top and bottom. They are easy to take—and especially easy to give to children and infants as they dissolve quickly on contact with saliva. There are no round, hard “globules” or “pilules” to count or roll off spoons or take forever to dissolve—like the typical homeopathic remedy in the “c” potency! Because the tablets are made with milk sugar, those who are lactose intolerant should ask the homeopathic pharmacy to prepare the cell salts in another form (sucrose, for example, or drops).

### trusted friends

Tissue salts, in their classic low potency form, are gentle little souls that can be repeated fairly frequently if needed, if the situation is serious—or not, if the right remedy quickly helps. Homeopathic remedies—including cell salts—act as catalysts, stimulating the body to heal itself. You will find it invaluable to make a relationship with a remedy that is working and be guided by your symptoms or your child’s symptoms—physical, general, and emotional—stopping and starting the remedy as needed. This general principle will help you on all your healing journeys, whatever the therapy.

### cell salt materia medica

The mini-descriptions below include the most common, everyday indications for the use of the 12 tissue salts, confirmed over a lifetime of using them in my own family and with my patients. More information can be found in, “The Twelve Tissue Remedies of Schüssler” by Boericke and Dewey, which includes all of Schüssler’s original indications and also incorporates symptoms elicited from provings by homeopaths Allen and Hering—thereby increasing the tissue salts’ homeopathic potential and usefulness.

### your beautiful bones: calcarea fluorica 

Also known as calcium fluoride.  
Affinities: bones, ligaments, muscles, teeth, veins.

This salt is a great tonic for muscles, ligaments and/or veins that have become worn out, flabby and lax—for tissues that have lost their elasticity and tone. For example, the prolapsed uterus or bladder (with dragging down sensations), hemorrhoids (that itch and bleed), or varicose veins.

It is useful for building the health and strength of teeth and bones during childhood, and after a serious injury to the bones, especially a fracture. It is also helpful for lumps that develop on bones (after a bad bruise to a bone or a fracture, for example) or around joints (after a bad sprain).

Use this tissue salt along with Calc phos and/or Silica to help build strong, healthy teeth and bones in infants, children, or adults, or to increase the strength of those whose enamel or bones are weak or whose teeth are producing cavities. It is an excellent tissue salt for bones that are thinning with age (osteoporosis or osteopenia) along with Calc phos and/or Silica.

Use it for back or joint pains that are worse on beginning to move and better for continued movement, just like the indications for the homeopathic remedy, Rhus toxicodendron. If Rhus tox is given, but helps just a little or not at all, then Calc fluor will usually help.

### general tonic: calcarea phosphorica

Also known as calcium phosphate or phosphate of lime.  
Affinities: bones, muscles, teeth.

This is a wonderful tonic for those who are mentally, emotionally, and/or physically exhausted after a period of mental work (like studying for exams), for those in the convalescent phase of an illness, or for infants, children, and young adults who are tired from a growth spurt. (See sidebar on page 21, “Dishrag String Bean Kids,” for more.)

Those responding best to this remedy tend to be sensitive to the cold and to drafts, which can cause a stiff neck. I have found it to be almost a specific for simple tension in the neck and trapezius muscles (the triangles between the points of the shoulder and the neck) from exhaustion or after physical stress and strain.

Use this tissue salt along with Calc fluor and/or Silica to help build strong, healthy teeth in infants, children, or adults, or to increase the strength of weak enamel or cavity-prone teeth.

It is also useful for building the health and strength of bones after a fracture—when it can be given in alternation with Calc fluor and/or Silica.

### yellow, blood-streaked stuff: calcarea sulphurica 

Also known as calcium sulphate or gypsum.  
Affinities: blood; mucous membranes; skin.

Use this cell salt for boils or abscesses that are discharging, but not healing, or for wounds that have become infected and pus-filled, especially with thick yellow pus that may be lumpy or blood-streaked. If the complaint looks like it should call for the homeopathic remedy Hepar sulph, but it does not respond to Hepar, think Calc sulph. It’s easy to remember this salt if you think of it as “a deeper Hepar.”

Consider Calc sulph for coughs, colds, earaches, and eye infections with discharges that are thick and yellow. Nasal mucus typically drips down the back of the throat or comes out one nostril, while the other side is blocked up. Calc sulph is for a croupy cough that is mostly there only in the morning on waking.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### any old iron: ferrum phosphoricum 

Also known as ferrum phosphate or phosphate of iron.  
Affinities: blood.

This salt is well known to help in the first stage of a fever or an acute illness (e.g., a cough or cold) before any clearly identifiable symptoms have developed. The person will be listless with flushed cheeks but no other clear symptoms—for example, you would not expect to see the restlessness that indicates the need for Aconite or the shiny eyes pointing to Belladonna.

Alternate Ferrum phos with Calc phos for simple anemia with low energy. The “calcium” helps the body to absorb the iron more effectively. These are wonderful remedies to give to pregnant women who are anemic, but loath to take medicines for fear of side effects. It is especially helpful for those who experience constipation and other side effects from iron supplements.

Think of Ferrum phos for nosebleeds either after an injury or when blowing the nose during a cough or cold.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### white stuff: kali muriaticum

Also known as potassium chloride or chloride of potash.  
Affinities: mucous membranes.

Think of Kali mur for coughs, stuffy head colds, or sinus infections with white discharges. The tongue is also coated white; white ulcers or thrush may be present in the mouth.

This remedy is for earaches, with congestion in the Eustachian tubes so that hearing is affected. It is brilliant for the snap, crackle, and popping noises in the ears after a cold.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### nerve tonic: kali phosphoricum 

Also known as potassium phosphate or phosphate of potash  
Affinities: nerves.

Use Kali phos for those who are worn out following a heavy work or study period. It is a good tonic for those in the convalescent stage of an acute illness (especially after flu) where there is muscular weakness and nervous exhaustion. People who need this remedy feel better for—and desperately need—warmth and rest, and a healthy diet to build themselves up again. They feel emotionally sluggish and can become mildly depressed. They get one-sided headaches, may be sensitive to light and noise, and be easily startled. They are also mentally sluggish and can’t concentrate even if they try. For women in childbirth who have become exhausted, I have given Kali phos, one dose in between every contraction for up to six doses…and their energy usually starts to return.

This remedy is also lovely for the simple insomnia that follows a period of excitement or intense work or mental strain, when a person feels worn out but cannot sleep.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### yellow stuff: kali sulphuricum 

Also known as potassium sulphate or glaserite.  
Affinities: mucous membranes; skin.

The indications for this remedy resemble those for Pulsatilla in that people who need it are generally worse for heat and better for fresh air. They also suffer from thick yellow discharges with a cough, a cold, or an earache, and the tongue is coated yellow, as well. The coughs are loose, but the mucus is difficult to cough up. During an earache, the person has crackling in the ears when chewing and temporary hearing loss from mucus in the middle ear.

A change of weather from cold to warm can bring on symptoms—a cough or a cold or joint pains that move around the body, that are worse for heat and better for a walk in the fresh air.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### homeopathic aspirin: magnesium phosphoricum 

Also known as magnesium phosphate.  
Affinities: muscles; nerves.

It has been called “the homeopathic aspirin” because of its ability to heal acute pains anywhere such as earache, headache, toothache (including teething in babies), and even sciatica—as long as the pains are better for heat and pressure. These are the key symptoms that will point the way to this remedy. The pains may be “neuralgic” (i.e., sharp pains that come and go).

Mag phos will also help cramps anywhere in the body—again, as long as they are better for heat and pressure. In fact, Mag phos is to painful menstrual periods in women what Chamomilla is for teething in babies; these remedies help so frequently in such cases because the symptoms are so common—to the remedy and to those suffering from the complaint. Mag phos won’t work for all women, but it will relieve a significant number suffering from this miserable complaint. It won’t necessarily cure the problem, but provide much appreciated relief—as long as the pains are much better for heat and pressure—the harder the better. Those needing this remedy can be found lying doubled up in bed with a hot water bottle (or heating pad) pressed into their crampy abdomens. Hot baths can also relieve the pains.

Mag phos works best when taken in warm water (boiled and partially cooled).  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### water balancer: natrum muriaticum 

Also known as sodium chloride or sea salt.  
Affinities: mucous membranes; skin.

The water balance of people needing Nat mur is disturbed. They suffer from dryness: of the mouth with a correspondingly big thirst; of the lips, which crack (especially the center of the lower lip); and of the bowels, which become constipated. I have also given it to pregnant women for simple water retention towards the end of their pregnancies, when the ankles are puffy but they have no other symptoms and are feeling well overall.

This is an excellent remedy for acute cold sores (herpes) on the lips and around the mouth, and also for blisters on the tip of the tongue, and/or painful mouth ulcers.  
It is indicated in the early stages of a dry cough and for colds with watery or clear but thick, egg white-like mucus.

A person needing this remedy may get back pain that is better for lying on a hard surface—like the floor.

Any of these symptoms can arise after a significant loss—of a loved one, a job, or a dream, for example—one that hasn’t been mourned or healed. The person holds in their tears, and this causes all sorts of problems from headaches to insomnia.

While the herpes and the headaches can come on after emotional stress, they can also be caused by too much heat, especially the heat of the sun, or by hormonal surges like around a menstrual period.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### acidity: natrum phosphoricum

Also known as sodium phosphate or phosphate of soda.  
Affinities: stomach; intestines.

Consider this remedy for those with sensitive, disordered digestive tracts. People who need this remedy cannot tolerate many foods—milk, fats, sweets, or vinegar—which cause acidity with heartburn, indigestion, and gas. They have acid belching after eating. This little remedy is helpful for infants with colic who vomit curdled milk after eating, and who are sensitive to cow’s milk.

This remedy may be used for itching of the anus due to worms, especially in children. They may have obstinate constipation or constipation alternating with sour-smelling diarrhea.

Think of the color yellow when thinking of this remedy! For someone needing this remedy, the back of the tongue (not the whole tongue) may be coated yellow, and the discharges are yellow.The eyes weep a yellow, creamy mucus, which causes the lids to stick together in the morning.Thick yellow mucus may drip down the back of the throat and be worse at night.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### green stuff: natrum sulphuricum 

Also known as sodium sulphate or glauber’s salt.  
Affinities: head, liver.

This is a fantastic remedy for headaches after an injury to the head—after Arnica has been given and the swelling has come right down.

People who need Nat sulph are vulnerable to cold, damp weather, or to humidity and they fall sick with a cough or a cold then. The mucus is green as is the coating on the tongue.

They experience colic, indigestion, and green diarrhea after starchy foods or fruits.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### homeopathic lancet: silica

Also known as silica oxide or flint.  
Affinities: bones, glands, hair, mucous membranes, nails, skin, teeth.

People needing this remedy tend to be sensitive, chilly, and sweaty types who catch cold easily. They may have become chilled in a cold wind or draft, or become worn out after a period of overwork. Either way, they can fall ill with a cough, earache, cold, or sinus infection. The glands will usually be swollen with an illness.

Hair and nails are weak, thin, and break easily. Teething babies take forever to produce teeth and get sick with diarrhea, cough, or a cold with every tooth. Silica is also useful for building the health and strength of bones after a fracture—when it can be given in alternation with Calc fluor and/or Calc phos.  
For boils or abscesses that are painful, but not discharging yet, Silica has a reputation as the “homeopathic lancet” because it hastens the suppuration or pus-formation process. Give after a splinter has become embedded, and it will help the foreign body to be “evicted!” It helps with infections and post-surgical scars that are inflamed, painful, and slow to heal.

Silica may be indicated for constipation with large, hard stools and lots of straining. Headaches after a heavy period of work or with a sinus infection—that settle over the eyes and make the forehead feel heavy—may be helped with Silica. This remedy may be useful for cracked skin anywhere, but especially between the toes of sweaty “athlete’s feet.”

### how to take cell salts  

*   **_Take_** the cell salt remedy in a 6X (not the 6c or 30c) potency.
*   **Repeat** the remedy according to the severity of the symptoms:
    *   **_Severe_**: every 1/2 to 1 hour (e.g., high fever, bad pain).
    *   **_Moderate_**: every 2 to 3 hours (e.g., bearable pain, bad cough)
    *   **_Mild_**: every 4 to 6 hours (e.g., able to carry on working!)
    *   **Tonic**: 3–4 times daily (e.g., tiredness after flu or osteoporosis, etc.) for 7–10 days at a time. Take a break of a week or so and repeat if need be. Healing after a bad fracture can take months with tissue salts helping along the way. See also “alternating remedies” below.
*   **Stop** **_on improvement_**: take it less often if there is moderate improvement, and stop taking it on significant improvement.
*   **_Repeat as needed:_** repeat the same remedy if it helped but then the symptoms return—starting and stopping as needed until completely better.
*   **Stop taking it** if it clearly isn’t working and select another or seek the advice of a professional homeopath.

Cell salts can be taken dry, on or under the tongue.  
They can also be dissolved in water if needed which makes it easy to repeat doses or to give to children or the elderly. Dissolve 4 tablets in 4 ounces of water and stir vigorously. You can take a teaspoon at a time as a dose, stirring vigorously before each dose, or just sip according to the frequency directions above.  
[⬆ Back to Contents](#top)

### alternating remedies 

Some tissue salts work well together—like Calc phos and Ferrum phos (for anemia), Calc phos and Kali phos (after an acute illness), or Calc phos and Mag phos (for cramps and growing pains in youngsters). Two remedies can be taken on the same day, but preferably not at the same time. The best schedule is to take one cell salt (say Calc phos) on waking and around mid afternoon and the other one (say Ferrum phos) around mid-day and at bedtime. Or one cell salt can be taken for a week and then the other for a week. In the case where three remedies are indicated—like Calc fluor, Calc phos, and Silica for building bones and/or teeth—one can be taken on waking, the second at mid-day, and the third at bedtime. Ideally, tissue salts taken this way, should not be taken for long periods of time without a break. I usually suggest that people take them Mondays to Fridays with the weekends off, or for two to three weeks and then one week off.

If a person who is sensitive to a particular cell salt takes it for too long, they can make their current symptoms worse or they may get symptoms they didn’t have before. Taking breaks from taking the remedy will enable you to spot this particular pattern.

### tissue salt combinations 

There are a number of combinations available—usually 3 or 4 cell salts combined into one tablet. Most of these combinations making sense. If you feel drawn to a particular combination, do check out the individual component salts by reading about them in a reference book/materia medica to make sure they make sense for your particular complaint or complaints.

Miranda Castro’s unique cell salt combination—Calcarea fluorica, Calcarea phosphorica, and Silica—is designed to enhance the strength and health of bones, hair, nails and teeth. It contains and is [available from our shop](https://mirandacastro.com/product-tag/cellsalts/).

### caution 

Do not self prescribe for chronic complaints. It is always advisable to seek professional advice for long-standing complaints. Check with your homeopath before self-prescribing if you or your child are under homeopathic care or have taken a constitutional remedy within the past month or so. Remedies have relationships with one another, and it would be a shame to take a tissue salt that inadvertently counteracts the effects of a constitutional remedy that has worked well.

1\. “The Twelve Tissue Remedies of Schüssler” by Drs. William Boericke and Willis A. Dewey.

2\. By comparison, most remedies with a “C” after the number (e.g., 6C) have been diluted one part of the original substance to ninety-nine parts of alcohol and then succussed (shaken vigorously against a firm but resilient surface) at each of the six dilutions. Pharmacies may sell this liquid or, more commonly, they place this liquid onto sucrose pellets, globules, or granules and package the remedy in that form. \[Note: Those substances that cannot be diluted/dissolved in water (i.e., insoluble minerals) must first be triturated (ground) in a mortar and pestle device and “diluted” with 99 parts of milk sugar a number of times, until they finally become soluble.\]
